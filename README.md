    - Store user’s ID card image
    - Store user’s PDF/DOC/XLS files
    - Store user’s video files

- Users must be able to retrieve their decrypted data
- Users must provide a pair of username and password to access their data
- You may use any cryptography library in any language (e.g., BouncyCastle, Java Crypto, PyCrypto, etc)
- The program must be bug-free to get a full mark
- Analyse the difference (i.e., running time, the resulting cipher text) between each cipher
- Download the data multiple times and measure the running time!
- Write a short report on the analysis result
- Justify all of your decisions during the development
- Plagiarism will get you 0 mark
- All code must be committed to Github and you need to put the link on the following link
